	 * 		n_q = 3   -> s		n_q = 4   -> 4
	 * 		n_q = 5   -> b
	 *  The digit \f$n_J\f$ encodes the total angular momentum \f$J\f$ of a
	 *  compound system. \f$n_L\f$ is used to distinguish compound objects which
	 *  have the same total angular momentum but different spin (\f$S\f$) and orbital
	 *  (\f$L\f$) angular momentum numbers. Finally, \f$n_r\f$ is used to label
	 *  mesons which are radially exited.
	 *
	 * @param pdgId The PDG ID to test.
	 *
	 * @return True if pdg ID corresponds to B hadron, false otherwise.
